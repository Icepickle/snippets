A dummy repository mainly for setting up a testing environment with some simple copy/pasting in jsfiddle or stackoverflow snippets

** Snippets **

*[React redux snippets](react-redux-snippet.html)*

Is an HTML containing:

 * cdn links for:
   * react, 
   * reactdom, 
   * redux, 
   * reactredux, 
   * reactsnippets
 * a default playground with some dummy data about persons that can be used as a test environment
 * integrates the babel browser integration

To comply with some standard, normal import statements are handled through a ````const```` declaration.

Could use redux-thunk, as a middleware however it is implemented with a very basic promiseAware middleware.
